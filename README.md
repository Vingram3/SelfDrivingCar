# SelfDrivingCar

This project is the start of a self-driving car. It uses an Arduino and sensors to check for obstacles immediately in front of it. If senses an obstacle, it will reverse and try to find a different path, free of obstacles. We plan on integrating our Google Teachable AI model into our car so that when it sees a particular thing, like a shoe, it will stop and honk. We plan to use a prebuilt car, Arduino, Google teachable AI, and possibly a geolocator.
